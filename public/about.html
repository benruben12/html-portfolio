<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Throughout my career journey, I have gained valuable experience in both <br/>
  technical and customer service roles. Originally from the Philippines, <br />
  I began my professional career as a computer salesman and technician, <br />
  honing my skills in hardware and software troubleshooting, <br />
  as well as providing exceptional customer support</p>

<p>Seeking new opportunities and growth, I made the bold decision to relocate <br />
  to the United Kingdom. Since then, I have been dedicatedly working as an office <br />
  and customer service assistant, where I have further expanded my skill set. <br />
  In this role, I have had the privilege to utilize Kofax third-party software for <br />
  efficiently indexing digital documents, enhancing workflow processes and ensuring <br />
  seamless organization of important information</p>

<p>Driven by my passion for continuous learning and my aspiration to stay up-to-date <br />
  with the rapidly evolving technology landscape, I recently completed a Level 3 certification <br />
  course in cybersecurity. This course not only provided me with a strong foundation in ensuring <br />
  the security and integrity of digital systems and networks but also instilled in me a profound <br />
  understanding of the importance of data protection and <br />
  risk management.
